input: design rules & device parameters

output: parametric cells of invidual photonic device building blocks (gdsfactory) 

=======

short notes: design rules ensure the geometric layouts compiles with foundary fabrication process (rules for PIC are different from those for IC)

useful references regarding PIC design rules:
